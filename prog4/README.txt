In order for the tester to run, the tester and the accompanying files must be placed at the same level as the 'code_linear_regression' and 'misc' folders.
The code will notify the parameters for which a run fails to be within a threshold of my output.
Based on various parameters, the CF & GD methods are tested along with the respective error method.
The predict method is not directly tested, and its respective logic is used in the error method.
