# This assignment is to practice the basics of Python coding, the Numpy ndarray operations, and the Jupiter Lab.

## Your work: 

- Please open and work on the following two files. These are two independent tasks that are not related to two each other. 
    - `numpy_warmup.ipynb`
    - `rec.py`

- See the instruction within those two files. 

- You do not need to change the enclosed file `rec_testing.ipynb` but can run it to test your `rec.py` code. 

- Zip the finished two files along with the `rec_testing.ipynb` file into one zip file named as: 
    `Lastname_your6digitewuid.zip`
    
- Submit the zip file to Canvas.


## Note:

- You can open the markdown file in JupiterLab and shows its preview for easier reading. 

- Do NOT submit the compiled bytecode from the `__pycache__` folder.
